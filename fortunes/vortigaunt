%
The Freeman must not proceed without the tau particle cannon!
%
With pleasure.
%
While our own lay scattered at your feet, you severed the vortal cord that bound the Nihilanth to life, and to us.
%
The Freeman honors us.
%
The Freeman honors us by his presence.
%
Our cause seems hopeless.
%
As you wish.
%
Caution, Freeman!
%
Lung gah...
%
Your mind is opaque.
%
Freeman, beware!
%
Excuse our gauche vicissitudes.
%
Communion of the vortessence. And that other: a deeper mystery. No deeper than the void itself.
%
Follow, Freeman.
%
We cannot forget those whose cords you cut. Forgiveness is not ours to bestow.
%
Riiit...
%
For the Freeman!
%
We fear we have failed you.
%
We have lost all dear to us.
%
Ware, Freeman!
%
The Eli Vance almost perceives the All-in-One.
%
Propitious alliance.
%
How often have we slipped our yoke, only to find it choking us again.
%
The Freeman must stand still.
%
Warning to the Freeman.
%
Our purpose is mutual.
%
Far distant eyes look out through yours.
%
We have dreamed of this moment.
%
Our place is here.
%
All we have is yours.
%
Undeserving of consciousness.
%
Chur lung gong chella gurr...
%
Hold still or we cannot charge you.
%
That sharp spur of hope has not dulled to this day. For once the lesser master lay defeated, we knew the greater must also fall in time.
%
To the void with you.
%
We are a tapestry woven of vortessence. It is the same for you if only you would see it.
%
It is an honor.
%
We serve the same mystery.
%
We claim you.
%
For a brief time you joined us. You are one. Between the worlds.
%
The Freeman will have need of these pheropods on the paths ahead. Gather them now.
%
Hold.
%
The Freeman can make use of this.
%
The Freeman must follow.
%
We call you sib, although your mind and meaning are a mystery to us.
%
Prepare to receive energy.
%
All in one and one in all.
%
We beg your awareness.
%
We remember the Freeman. We are coterminous.
%
Where to now? And to what end?
%
We are honored.
%
We are yours.
%
That should keep the Freeman safe.
%
You are deluded.
%
It is all one in the plenitude.
%
This marks a turning point.
%
Certainly.
%
Accept a charge.
%
By our honor.
%
We take our stand beside you, here, upon this miserable rock.
%
This is regrettable.
%
There is more to the Freeman than meets the eye.
%
Gladly we accompany.
%
Taaar...
%
It's it the Freeman?
%
Caution!
%
It's there reason for delay?
%
The Eli Vance is indispensable to the liberation.
%
Allow me.
%
We are pleased that the Eli Vance thinks so highly of the Freeman.
%
We deem this company inviolable.
%
Truly it is the Freeman.
%
We have lost all dear to us.
%
The Freeman must move.
%
The Freeman will now break out his pheropods and toss one into yonder pit.
%
Nothing of the sort.
%
Freeman, take us with you.
%
The Freeman has done well.
%
The Freeman does us honor.
%
The tether is cut.
%
Such pessimism will doom us all.
%
Satisfaction.
%
You must remember us from Black Mesa.
%
Stand clear.
%
Unless we wish to say unflattering things about you.
%
Let this war end in either total victory or our extinction. No further compromise shall we allow.
%
Node and nexus, feed upon this life!
%
This body is yours to command.
%
Lead on.
%
We live to serve.
%
The Freeman must not delay: Hurl that pheropod into the pit.
%
Unity of purpose, the shattering of common shackles, a single road we tread.
%
We cannot read the Freeman's optical buds.
%
Can we not convince you otherwise?
%
Yes, we will vocalize in your auditory language as a matter of courtesy.
%
That is all.
%
The Freeman knows best.
%
We are you, Freeman. And you are us.
%
This is unaccustomed.
%
The Freeman will do wise to heed our extraction of the myrmidont's aromatic pheropods. The process is not entirely hygienic. Therefore, stand aside.
%
The Freeman will accept this weapon, or suffer greatly on the road ahead! (Airboat gun Vortigaunt in the Canals, in sound/vo/coast/barn)
%
Your bright face obscures your darker mask.
%
We will remain if you so instruct.
%
Our finest poet describes it thus: Gallum galla gilla ma.
%
You humans, always in the qualidity.
%
It's this the Freeman we see before our eyes?
%
Churr galing chur alla gung...
%
We surge.
%
Could you but see the eyes inside your own, the minds in your mind, you would see how much we share.
%
The Freeman must excuse us. It is rude of us to commune by flux shifting in front of those whose vortal inputs are impaired.
%
Empower us!
%
Attend, now, and learn to shepherd antlions with this so-called bug-bait.
%
We see you still in Black Mesa. Clearly we see you in the Nihilanth's chamber.
%
Calm yourself.
%
The feeling is mutual.
%
We cannot fire without harm to the Freeman.
%
That is all we can spare.
%
The Freeman again excels at all tasks!
%
Here we stay.
%
We have survived worse across the ages.
%
The way ahead is dark for the moment.
%
That one shall trouble us no more.
%
Just so.
%
Idle speculation.
%
If you are truly the Freeman, we salute you.
%
Don't rely on it..
%
The Freeman shows his excellence in all things.
%
Galanga...
%
Hurl your bug-bait hard against the dummy.
%
Ware!
%
Likewise, we are sure.
%
Give over your essence.
%
We will help you.
%
We will put aside Black Mesa... for now.
%
We remain unconvinced.
%
Pass on!
%
Ah ghurrrr...
%
Our life is worthless unless spent on freedom.
%
We have survived darker times.
%
We know you.
%
You have brought us grief and jubilation beyond measure.
%
Hold still.
%
Can we be of service?
%
The Freeman must squeeze his bug-bait sharply if he wishes the antlions to follow where he leads.
%
Hope is in sight.
%
Perhaps we will serve you better here.
%
Return to the all in one.
%
We wish you were right.
%
We never dreamed to meet you in corporeal form.
%
We dedicate ourselves to your purpose.
%
Freeman.
%
This tau cannon once killed many of our kind. Use it wisely.
%
The Freeman must now hurry on! The Eli Vance is held in distress most dire! (Vortigaunt in N.L.O., in sound/coast/odessa)
%
This is more than anyone can bear, but we will persevere.
%
We shall prevail.
%
Yes, forward.
%
The Freeman.
%
Your companionship is greatly belabored.
%
If you move we cannot help you.
%
Gladly.
%
The Freeman can also coax his antlions to attack specific targets. Observe the training manikin, and mark it well with another pheropod.
%
We cannot heal a moving target.
%
Onward!
%
To our honor we follow you.
%
Assume nothing.
%
Affirmed.
%
We have endured these chafing bonds for eons, yet a single moment of further servitude seems intolerable!
%
Greetings to the Freeman.
%
With you besides us, a talisman of victory, the day of freedom draws nigh.
%
We are there still, in observance of your final stroke.
%
The Freeman is in our way.
%
We follow the Freeman.
%
You're not the first to harbor such illusions.
%
What seems to you a sacrifice is merely, to us, an oscillation. We do not fear the interval of darkness.
%
We are still here.
%
Something secret steers us both. We shall not name it.
%
The Eli Vance has earned our trust.
%
The Combine will pay in kind for their depravity.
%
We believe the opposite.
%
This is the Freeman. The Combine's reckoning has come.
%
Freeman, we could be of use to you.
%
Comes a man? It is! The Freeman!
%
The Freeman will now be instructed in the use of pheropods.
%
To our glorious end.
%
And now this one must bid the Freeman farewell. Nova Prospekt lies just beyond. Remember well what you have learned here. The Eli Vance has greatest confidence in you.
%
Now, attend well. Apply pressure to your pheropod, to signal the antlions in your command to follow you.
%
Forward!
%
It is just as well.
%
Yes!
%
Well met, Freeman.
%
That is all for now.
%
We expected as much.
%
We will charge you.
%
Allow us to recharge your cells.
%
Gong...
%
How many are there in you? Whose hopes and dreams do you encompass?
%
We are mindful of the words of our greatest philosopher: companum gannennen vorgenot!
%
There is no distance between us. No false veils of time or space may intervene.
%
Its energy empowers us.
%
It's it the Freeman?
%
Assent.
%
Ga la lung...
%
The Freeman must beware!
%
The Freeman must retrieve the fallen pheropods without delay!
%
Your concern is touching.
%
We bear witness to the bright eternity of the Nihilanth's demise. You leap, you fall, we see you flash between the barriers.
%
Accept energy.
%
It is the Freeman.
%
Return to the void.
%
Lead us.
%
The honor is ours.
%
We shall share the vortessence.
%
The Eli Vance was our first collaborator.
%
For Freedom! (Airboat gun Vortigaunt in the Canals)
%
So the neuroprints are true.
