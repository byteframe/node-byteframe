As far as anyone knows we're a nice, normal family.
%
It says it's for dogs, but she can't read.
%
Lisa:	Remember, Dad.  The handle of the Big Dipper points to the 
	North Star.

Homer:	That's nice, Lisa, but we're not in astronomy class.  We're in
	the woods.
%
Yeah.  Wait a minute.  It's the guy from TV.  My kid's 
hero...Cruddy...Crummy...Krusty the Clown!
%
Uh, so.  Let's have a conversation.  Uh, I think we'll find that we have
very little in common.
%
Don't go easy on each other just because you're brother and sister.  I
want to see you both fighting for your parents' love.
%
I don't want to look like a weirdo.  I'll just go with a muumuu.
%
Oh my God!  Space aliens!  Don't eat me, I have a wife and kids!  Eat
them.
%
Marge, tell Bart I just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like I do
every morning.
%
You know, Moe, my mom once said something that really stuck with me.  She
said, `Homer, you're a big disappointment,' and, God bless her soul, she
was really onto something.
%
Lisa:	So gambling makes a good thing even better?

Homer:	That's right.  My God, it's like there's some kind of bond
	between us.
%
Jeez.  No beer ... no opera dogs ...
%
You're everywhere.  You're omnivorous.
%
I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what
about those really smart ones who live among us who rollerskate and smoke
cigars?
%
You know something, folks, as ridiculous as this sounds, I would rather
feel the sweet breath of my beautiful wife on the back of my neck as I
sleep than stuff dollar bills into some stranger's G-string.
%
Could this be the best day of my life?
%
Kirk:	One day your wife is making you your favorite meal, the next day
	you're thawin'a hot dog in a gas station sink.

Homer:	Oh, that's tough, pal.  But it's never gonna happen to me.
%
See these?  American donuts.  Glazed, powdered, and raspberry-filled.
Now, how's that for freedom of choice.
%
The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show
starring my wife's sisters -- or as I call them, `the gruesome twosome.'
%
I'm not a bad guy.  I work hard and I love my kids.  So why should I spend
half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to Hell?
%
Mmm...incapacitating.
%
Marge, try to understand.  There are two kinds of college students: jocks
and nerds.  As a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time.
%
Listen, you big, stupid space-creature.  Nobody, but nobody, eats the
Simpsons!
%
I wore my extra loose pants for nothing.  Nothing!
%
You've been rubbing my nose in it since I got here!  Your family is better
than my family, your beer comes from farther away than my beer, you and
your son like each other, your wife's butt is higher than my wife's butt!
You make me sick!
%
Son, this is the only time I'm ever gonna say this.  It is not okay to
lose.
%
As I got up in front of them, I felt an intoxication that had nothing to
do with alcohol.  It was the intoxication of being a public spectacle.
%
Homer:	What?!  Flanders!  You're the Devil?

Devil Flanders:
	Ho-oh, it's always the one you least suspect.
%
D'oh!  English!  Who needs that?  I'm never going to England. Come on,
let's smoke.
%
They don't call me Colonel Homer because I'm some dumb-ass army guy.
%
I want to share something with you -- the three little sentences that will
get you through life.  Number one, `Cover for me.'  Number two, `Oh, good
idea, boss.'  Number three, `It was like that when I got here.'
%
Always remember that you're representing our country.  I guess what I'm
saying is, don't mess up France the way you messed up your room.
%
I can't believe I ate the whole thing.
%
Barney:	Boy, you never stop eating and you don't gain a pound.

Homer:	It's my metaba-ma-lism.  I guess I'm just one of the lucky ones.
%
Marge, you're my wife and I love you very much.  But you're living in a
world of makebelieve.  With flowers and bells and leprechauns.  And magic
frogs with funny little hats...
%
Did you hear that, Marge?  She called me a baboon!  The stupidest,
ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!
%
Holy Moly!  The bastard's rich!
%
Love isn't hopeless.  Look, maybe I'm no expert on the subject, but there
was one time I got it right.
%
First Bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals, then he makes fun
of the way I talk -- probably -- now he steals my right to raise a
disobedient, smart-alecky son!  Well, that's it!
%
If there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise!
%
Keep brain from freezing.
%
Lurleen, I can't get your song outta my mind.  I haven't felt this way 
since `Funky Town.'
%
Marge:	Homer, couldn't we pawn my engagement ring instead?

Homer:	Now, I appreciate that, honey, but we need one hundred and fifty
	dollars here.
%
Marge:	Homer, you're his father.  You've got to reason with him.

Homer:	Oh, that never works.  He's a goner!
%
I thought there was chocolate inside ... Well, why was it wrapped in foil?
%
I don't care if Ned Flanders is the nicest guy in the world.  He's a 
jerk -- end of story.
%
Well, you know boys, a nuclear reactor is a lot like a woman.  You just
have to read the manual and press the right button.
%
Homer:	Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps.

Bart:	Don't worry, I don't even like using the bathroom after you.

Homer:	Why you little -- !
%
I wish for a turkey sandwich on rye bread with lettuce and mustard.  And
-- and I don't want any zombie turkeys, I don't want to turn into a turkey
myself, and I don't want any other weird surprises -- you got it?
%
Homer:	I'm a bad father!

Selma:	You're also fat!

Homer:	I'm also fat!
%
Foul temptress.  I'll bet she thinks Ziggy's gotten too preachy, too!
%
Homer:	No TV and No Beer Make Homer ... something something.

Marge:	Go crazy?

Homer:	Don't mind if I do!
%
It all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the
eighties.  Those were idealistic days: the candidacy of John Anderson,
the rise of Supertramp.  It was an exciting time to be young.
%
Twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life.
%
Homer:	I don't want you to see me sitting on my worthless butt.

Bart:	We've seen it, Dad.
%
Marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat.  It also gives me the 
right -- no, the duty -- to make a complete ass of myself.
%
Herb:	I want you to help me design a car.  A car for all the Homer
	Simpsons out there!  And I want to pay you two hundred thousand
	dollars a year!

Homer:	And I want to let you!
%
Homer:	There couldn't be heaven if there weren't a hell.

Bart:	Who's in there?

Homer:	Oh, uh ... Hitler's dog.  And that dog Nixon had, whassisname, um,
	Chester ...

Lisa:	Checkers.

Homer:	Yeah!  One of the Lassies is in there, too.  The mean one -- the
	one that mauled Jimmy.
%
Losers!  Losers!  Kiss my big Springfield behind, Shelbyville!
%
The doll's trying to kill me, and the toaster's been laughing at me.
%
Karl:	You don't belong here.  You're a fraud and a phony and it's only
	a matter of time until they find you out.

Homer:	(gasps)  Who told you?
%
Bart:	What'd you do?  Screw up like the Beatles and say you were bigger
	than Jesus?

Homer:	All the time.  It was the title of our second album.
%
Kirk:	What makes you guys so special?

Homer:	Because Marge and I have one thing that can never be broken: a
	strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.
%
Ah, sweet pity: where would my love life have been without it?
%
Oh, honey, I didn't get drunk, I just went to a strange fantasy world.
%
Bart:	So, like sometimes you can do stuff that you think is pretty bad
	so other kids will like you better?

Homer:	You're not talking about killing anyone, are you?
%
I'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress 'em up, and make 'em reenact the Civil
War!  Heh, heh, heh!
%
Weaseling out of things is important to learn.  It's what separates us
from the animals.  Except the weasel.
%
Homer:	Your mother and I have been thinking about giving the puppies
	away.

Bart and Lisa:
	Noooooo!

Homer:	Mainly your mother.
%
Homer:	Okay, okay, don't panic.  To find Flanders, I just have to think
	like Flanders!

Homer's Brain:
	I'm a big four-eyed lame-o and I wear the same stupid sweater
	everyday, and --

Homer:	The Springfield River!
%
It was the most I ever threw up, and it changed my life forever.
%
We live in a society of laws.  Why do you think I took you to all those
"Police Academy" movies?  For fun?  Well, I didn't hear anybody laughin',
did you?
%
Stealing?!  How could you?!  Haven't you learned anything from that
guy who gives those sermons at church?  Captain What's-his-name?
%
Aw, Dad, you've done a lot of great things, but you're a very old man, and
old people are useless.
%
Homer:	Little baby batter,
	Can't control his bladder!

Burns:	Mmm...Crude, but I like it.  What do you say we freshen up out
	little drinkie poos?

Homer:	Don't mind if I do.
%
Homer:	Hey, Flanders, it's no use praying.  I already did the same thing,
	and we can't both win.

Flanders:
	Actually, Simpson, we were praying that no one gets hurt.
%
Asleep at the switch!  I wasn't asleep!  I was drunk!
%
Hey!  Let's do that 2,000-pound man thing.  I'll be that Carl Reiner guy,
and you be what's-his-face.
%
Don't let Krusty's death get you down, boy.  People die all the time.
Just like that.  Why, you could wake up dead tomorrow.  Well, good night.
%
Hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every Sunday?  I
mean, isn't God everywhere?
%
And anyone can be tooted?
%
Flanders:
	Homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors, but you made us
	friends.

Homer:	To Ned Flanders, the richest left-handed man in town.
%
There's an empty spot I've always had inside me.  I tried to fill it with
family, religion, community service.  But those were all dead ends.  I
think this chair is the answer.
%
Bart:	Dad, you killed the Zombie Flanders!

Homer:	He was a zombie?
%
If it'll make you feel any better, I've learned that life is one crushing
defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead.
%
See you in hell, candy boys!!
%
All right.  His story checks out.
%
I didn't want a hokey second wedding like those ones on TV!  This one's
for real!
%
Hmmm, look at those eyes.  He's trying to hypnotize me, but not in the
good Las Vegas way.
%
Marge!  I'm two-thirty-nine, and I'm feeling fine!
%
I know you're mad at me right now, and I'm kinda mad too ... I mean, we
could sit here and try to figure out who forgot to pick up who till the
cows come home.  But let's just say we're both wrong and that'll be that.
%
Well if it isn't the leader of the weiner patrol, boning up on his nerd
lessons!
%
Yeah.  Maybe I do have the right ... What's that stuff?
%
And, Lord, we're especially thankful for nuclear power, the cleanest,
safest energy source there is, except for solar, which is just a pipe
dream.
%
Marge, you being a cop makes you the man!  Which makes me the woman -- and
I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear,
which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.
%
Hello?  Yes?  Oh!  Heh, heh, uh ... if you're looking for that big donut
of yours ... um, Flanders has it.  Just smash open his house.  (Closing
the door.)  He came to life.  Good for him.
%
He may have come up with the recipe, but I came up with the idea of
charging $6.95 for it.
%
Wh ... what's going on?  Wh ... wha ... why am I on a Japanese box?
%
Wait a minute, Marge.  I saw "Mrs. Doubtfire."  This is a man in drag!
%
Abe:	I used to be `with it.'  But then they changed what `it' was.  Now
	what I'm `with' isn't `it' and what's `it' seems weird and scary
	to me.  It'll happen to you.

Homer:	No way, man.  We're gonna keep on rockin' forever!
%
Yes!  Oh, yes!  Read it and weep!  In your face -- I got more chicken
bone!
%
Must destroy mankind!  (His watch alarm goes off)  Ooh, lunchtime!
%
Okay, Marge, as long as we're traumatizing the kids, I have a scandalous
story of my own.
%
Marge:	Homer, is this the way you pictured married life?

Homer:	Yup, pretty much.  Except we drove around in a van solving
	mysteries.
%
Out at five, catch General Sherman at five-thirty, clean him at six, eat
him at six-thirty, back in bed by seven with no incriminating evidence.
Heh heh heh.  The perfect crime.
%
I'll work from midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat
breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to bask
in Lisa's love, then I'm off to the power plant fresh as a daisy.
%
Just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball and release it at an
appropriate time.  Like that day I hit that referee with a whiskey 
bottle.  'Member that?
%
Come here, you little raven!
%
Your mother seems really upset.  I better go have a talk with 
her -- during the commercial.
%
Homer:	The secret ingredient is --

Moe:	Homer, no!

Homer:	Cough syrup!  Nothing but plain, ordinary, over-the-counter 
	children's cough syrup!
%
Hee, hee!  I can be a jerk and no one can stop me!
%
I bet Einstein turned himself all sorts of colors before he invented the
lightbulb.
%
It could be one of these chemicals here that makes him so smart.  Lisa,
maybe you should try some of this.
%
Dammit, I'm no supervising technician.  I'm a technical supervisor.  It's
too late to teach this old dog new tricks.
%
That shot is impossible!  Jack Nicholson himself couldn't make it!
%
Homer:	I keep hearing this horrible irregular thumping noise.

Pump Jockey:
	It's your heart.  And I think it's on its last thump.

Homer:	Whew, I was afraid it was my transmission.
%
Rock 'n' Roll had become stagnant.  `Achy Breaky Heart' was seven years
away.  Something had to fill the void, and that something was barbershop.
%
Flanders!  My socks feel dirty!  Gimme some water to wash 'em!
%
Kent:	Well, what do you say to the accusation that your group has been
	causing more crimes than it's been preventing?

Homer:	Oh, Kent, I'd be lying if I said my men weren't committing crimes.
%
Marge, there's just too much pressure, what with my job, the kids, traffic
snarls, political strife at home and abroad.  But I promise you, the second
all of those things go away, we'll have sex.
%
It works on any Ayatollah!  Ayatollah Nakhbadeh, Ayatollah Zahedi ... Even
as we speak, Ayatollah Razmara and his cadre of fanatics are consolidating
their power!
%
Um, it's like, uh ... did anyone see the movie `Tron'?
%
I think Smithers picked me because of my motivational skills.
%
You can't depend on me all your lives.  You have to learn that there's a
little Homer Simpson in all of us.
%
When will I learn?  The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of
a bottle.  They're on TV!
%
Homer:	This place is depressing.

Grampa:	Hey!  I live here.

Homer:	Oh, well, I'm sure it's a blast	once you get used to it.
%
Lisa:	Dad, I think that's pretty spurious.

Homer:	Well, thank you, honey.
%
Selma:	It's time to give away my love like so much cheap wine.

Homer:	Take it to the hoop, Selma!
%
Burns:	Good Lord, Smithers!  You look atrocious.  I thought I told you to
	take a vacation.

Homer:	Uh, Smithers already left, sir.  I'm his replacement, Homer
	Simpson.
%
Bart:	Oh, cheer up, Mom.  You can't buy publicity like that.  Thousands
	and thousands of people saw your pretzels injuring Whitey Ford.

Homer:	You can call them Whitey-whackers!
%
Oh, `no attitude,' eh?  Not `in your face,' huh?  Well, you can cram it
with walnuts, ugly!
%
Homer:	I'm sorry, Marge, but sometimes I think we're the worst family in
	town.

Marge:	Maybe we should move to a larger community.
%
Two-hundred-thirty-nine pounds?!  I'm a blimp!  Why are all the good
things so tasty?
%
And thank you most of all for nuclear power, which is yet to cause a
single proven fatality, at least in this country.
%
Quiet, you kids!  If I hear one more word, Bart doesn't get to watch
cartoons and Lisa doesn't get to go to college.
%
Bart:	I had a fight with Milhouse.

Homer:	That four-eyes with the big nose?  You don't need friends like
	that.

Lisa:	How Zen.
%
Homer:	Well, the evening began at the Gentleman's Club, where we were
	discussing Wittgenstein over a game of backgammon.

Scully:	Mr. Simpson, it's a felony to lie to the FBI.

Homer:	We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard.  Ya
	happy?
%
Flanders:
	They're not perfect, but the Lord says love they neighbor --

Homer:	Shut up, Flanders.

Flanders:
	Okely-dokely-do.
%
Boy, when Marge first told me she was going to the Police Academy, I
thought it's be fun and exciting, like the movie `Spaceballs.'  But
instead, it's been painful and disturbing, like the movie `Police
Academy.'
%
Bart:	Wow, Dad, you took a baptismal for me.  How do you feel?

Homer:	Oh, Bartholomew, I feel like St. Augustine of Hippo after his
	conversion by Ambrose of Milan.
%
That's fine for you, Marge.  But I used to rock and roll all night and
party every day.  Then it was every other day.  Now I'm lucky if I can
find half an hour a week in which to get funky.  I've got to get out of
this rut and back into the groove!
%
Good morning, fellow employee.  You'll notice that I am now a model 
worker.  We should continue this conversation later, during the designated
break periods.  Sincerely, Homer Simpson.
%
A boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center.
%
Apu:	You look familiar, sir.  Are you on the television or something?

Homer:	Sorry, buddy.  You got me confused with Fred Flintstone.
%
Now, son, you don't want to drink beer.  That's for daddys, and kids with
fake IDs.
%
Marge:	Homer, remember you promised you'd try to limit pork to six
	servings a week?

Homer:	Marge, I'm only human.
%
Oh, look at me!  I'm making people happy.  I'm the magical man from
Happyland in a gumdrop house on Lollipop Laaane!  Oh, by the way, I
was being sarcastic.
%
I may just quit my job at the plant to become a full-time stock market
guy.
%
Why did this have to happen now, during prime time, when TV's
brightest stars come out to shine?
%
Oh my God, someone's trying to kill me!  Oh wait, it's for Bart.
%
It all happened during the magical summer of 1985.  A maturing Joe
Piscopo left `Saturday Night Live' to conquer Hollywood; People
Express introduced a generation of hicks to plane travel; and I was
in a barbershop quartet.
%
Burns:	I can't understand a word you're saying.

Homer:	My name is Homer Simpson!

Burns:	You're just babbling incoherently...

Homer:	Oh, you're a dead man, Burns.  Oh, you're dead!  You're dead,
	Burns!
%
Burns:	Oh, quit cogitating, Steinmetz, and use an open-faced club!  A
	sand wedge!

Homer:	Mmm ... open-faced club sandwich.
%
Woman:	Your son was trespassing on my property and destroyed a very
	valuable stone gargoyle, and -- Are you wearing a grocery bag?

Homer:	I have misplaced my pants.
%
Anyway, we'd like to thank you for the occasional moments of peace and
love our family's experienced ... well, not today.  You saw what
happened.  Oh, Lord, be honest.  Are we the most pathetic family in
the universe, or what?
%
This is the greatest thrill of my life!  I'm king of the world!  Wooo,
wooo!  Wooo, wooo!
%
Lisa, if you don't like your job you don't strike.  You just go in
every day and do it really half-assed.  That's the American way.
%
Oh, I love your magazine.  My favorite section is `How to Increase
Your Word Power.'  That thing is really, really, really ... good.
%
One day you may achieve something that we Simpsons have dreamed about
for generations.  You may outsmart someone.
%
The code of the schoolyard, Marge!  The rules that teach a boy how to
be a man!  Let's see; don't tattle, always make fun of those different
from you, never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly
the same way you do.
%
Homer:	Ooh, look at this one!  The Hammer of Thor!  (Reading)  "It
	will send your pins to ... Valhalla?"  Lisa?

Lisa:	Valhalla is where vikings go when they die.

Homer:	Ooh, that's some ball.
%
Marge:	Name one of your child's friends.

Homer:	Uh, let's see, Bart's friends ... Well, there's the fat kid
	with the thing; uh, the little wiener whose always got his
	hands in his pockets.
%
Smithers:
	Next.  There's a problem with the reactor -- what do you do?

Homer:	There's a problem with the reactor??  We're all going to die!!
%
Hey, if you're going to get mad at me every time I do something
stupid, then I guess I'll just have to stop doing stupid things!
%
I'm tired of being a wanna-be league bowler, I wanna be a league bowler!
%
Marge:	I know we didn't ask for this, Homer, but doesn't the Bible
	say, "Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you
	do unto me...?"

Homer:	Yes, but doesn't the Bible also say, "Thou shalt not take
	moochers into thy hut?"
%
Homer:	All right, Herb.  I'll lend you the 2,000 bucks.  But you have
	to forgive me and treat me like a brother.

Herb:	Nope.

Homer:	All right, then, just give me the drinking bird.
%
Burns:	Well, Simpson, I must say, once you're been through something
	like that with a person, you never want to see that person again.

Homer:	You said it, you weirdo.
%
Marge, please, old people don't need companionship.  They need to be
isolated and studied, so it can be determined what nutrients they have
that might be extracted for our personal use.
%
Marge:	Maybe it'll turn out that he was innocent all along.

Homer:	Earth to Marge.  Earth to Marge.  I was there ... the clown's
	G-I-L-L-T-Y.
%
Oh, cruel fate.  Why do you mock me?
%
Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh
start with Maggie.
%
Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing
out, I'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new belly button.
%
Boy, I don't know.  You gotta be pretty desperate to make it with a robot.
%
You mean, I'm on my own?  I've never been on my own.  Oh no!  On 
own!  On own!  I need help.  Oh, God help me!  Help me, God!
%
Homer:	Is this episode going on the air live?

June Bellamy:
	No, Homer.  Very few cartoons are broadcast live -- it's a 
	terrible strain on the animators' wrists.
%
Homer:	Hey, Burns!  Eat my shorts!

Burns:	Who the Sam Hill was that?
%
Six simple words: I'm not gay, but I'll learn.
%
Donuts.  Is there anything they can't do?
%
Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans.
Sure I'm flattered, maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no!
%
Homer:	You like parties, huh?  Well, I just remembered they're having
	a big one down at the waterfront this weekend.

Marge:	You didn't remember that.  You just saw it on TV.
%
Even the Chinese are against me.
%
Homer:	Here's your magazines.  How many of these guys are named Corey?

Lisa:	Eight.  Thanks, Dad.
%
No, I do not know what the Schadenfreude is.  Please tell me, because
I'm dying to know.
%
I've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer.  Basically, we
become a family of traveling acrobats.
%
Marge, let's end this feudin' and a-fussin' and get down to some lovin'.
%
It takes two to lie.  One to lie and one to listen.
%
When it comes to compliments, women are ravenous, bloodsucking
monsters, always wanting more, more, more!  And if you give it to 'em, 
you'll get back plenty in return.
%
I'm sick of eating hoagies!  I want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long
hero!  I want to live, Marge!  Won't you let me live?  Won't you,
please?
%
The weak and nerdy are admired for their computer-programming abilities.
%
Kids, kids, kids.  As far as Daddy's concerned, you're both potential
murderers.
%
Marge:	We're just going to have to cut down on luxuries.

Homer:	Well, you know, we're always buying Maggie vaccinations for
	diseases she doesn't even have.
%
Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons!
%
TV Announcer:
	The following is a public service announcement: Excessive
	alcohol consumption can cause liver damage and cancer of the
	rectum.

Homer:	Mmm ... beer.
%
Oh, Lisa, you and your stories.  `Bart is a vampire.'  `Beer kills
brain cells.'  Now, let's go back to that ... building ... thingee
... where our beds and TV ... is.
%
I'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me -- friends, co-workers, 
Tibor.  I never thought it'd be my own wife.
%
You are not my son!
%
De-fault!  The two sweetest words in the English language.
%
Reverend Lovejoy:
	Homer, this is really low.

Homer:	Not as low as my low, low prices!
%
Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win 
or lose: it's how drunk you get.

You don't know what it's like -- I'm the one out there every day
putting his ass on the line.  And I'm not out of order!  You're out of 
order!  The whole freaking system is out of order!
%
Forget it, Marge, it's Chinatown!
%
I can't live the button-down life like you.  I want it all!  The
terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles!
%
Sure, I might offend a few of the blue-noses with my cocky stride and
musky odors -- oh, I'll never be the darling of the so-called `City
Fathers' who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about
`What's to be done with this Homer Simpson"'
%
It's okay, Marge.  I've learned my lesson.  A mountain of sugar is too
much for one man.  It's clear now why God portions it out in those 
tiny packets, and why he lives on a plantation in Hawaii.
%
Marge, what's wrong?  Are you hungry?  Sleepy?  Gassy?  Gassy?  Is it
gas?  It's gas, isn't it?
%
You want the truth?  You want the truth?  You can't handle the truth!
'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that
used to be your best friend's face, you'll know what to do!
%
Read your town charter, boy.  `If food stuffs should touch the ground,
said food stuffs shall be turned over to the village idiot.'  Since I
don't see him around, start shoveling!
%
Homer:	You can let him down gently, but over the next couple of
	months, I want you to break it off.

Marge:	Um, okay, Homer.

Homer:	Whoof!  That was a close one, kids.
%
Homer:	Aw, Marge, kids, I miss my club.

Marge:	Oh, Homey.  You know, you are a member of a very exclusive
	club.

Homer:	The Black Panthers?
%
If the Bible has taught us nothing else -- and it hasn't -- it's that
girls should stick to girls' sports, such as hot oil wrestling and
foxy boxing and such and such.
%
All right, let's not panic.  I'll make the money back by selling one
of my livers.  I can get by with one.
%
I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around a city,
keeping its speed over fifty, and if its speed dropped, it would
explode!  I think it was called `The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down.'
%
Man:	You must be stupider than you look.

Homer:	Stupider like a fix!
%
Lenny:	Yeah, he got injured on the job and they sent him home with
	pay.  Pfft.  It's like a lottery that rewards stupidity.

Homer:	Stupidity, eh?
%
Bart:	I'll take up smoking and give that up.

Homer:	Good for you, son.  Giving up smoking is one of the hardest
	things you'll ever have to do.  Have a dollar.
%
Marge:	I would love you if you weighed 1,000 pounds but ...

Homer:	Beautiful.  G'night.
%
Oh, I always wanted to be a teamster.  So lazy and surly.
%
This is the darkest day in the history of Springfield.  If anybody
wants me I'll be in the shower.
%
All right, I have thought this through.  I will send Bart the money to 
fly home, then I will murder him.
%
Second class?  What about Social Security, bus discounts, Medic-Alert
jewelery, Gold Bond powder, pants all the way up to your armpits, and
all those other senior perks?  Oh, if you ask me, old folks have it
pretty sweet.
%
Hey, if you want wild bears eatin' your children and scarin' your
salmon, that's your business.  But I'm not gonna take it!  Who's with
me?
%
Marge:	You don't have to join a freak show just because the
	opportunity came along.

Homer:	You know, Marge, in some ways you and I are very different
	people.
%
Homer:	We chained Hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a
	bucket of fish heads once a week.

Marge:	It saved out marriage!
%
Bart:	Can I be a boozehound?

Homer:	Not till you're 15.
%
Flanders:
	Y'know, Simpson, I feel kinda silly, but, uh, you know, what
	the hey, you know ... kinda reminds me of my good ole
	fraternity days.

Homer:	D'oh!  Oh my God!  He's enjoying it!
%
Look, just gimme some inner peace, or I'll mop the floor with ya!
%
Marge, look at me!  We've been separated for a day, and I'm as dirty
as a Frenchman.  In another few hours, I'll be dead.  I can't afford
to lose your trust again.
%
I'm just saying, why not have two geniuses in the family?  Sort of a
spare in case Bart's brain blows up.
%
I couldn't very well chop your hand off and bring it to the store,
could I?
%
You know, some of these stories are pretty good.  I never knew mice
lived such interesting lives.
Herb:	All born in wedlock?

Homer:	Yeah, though the boy was a close call.
%
Oooh ... maca-ma-damia nuts.
%
Boy, those Germans have a word for everything.
%
I saw weird stuff in that place last night.  Weird, strange, sick,
twisted, eerie, godless, evil stuff.  And I want in.
%
He's taking funny talk.
%
Marge:	We can't afford to buy a pony.

Homer:	Marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to
	buy a pony.
%
I've heard 'em all.  `I like you as a friend.'  `I think we should see 
other people.'  `I no speak English.'  `I'm married to the sea.'  `I
don't want to kill you, but I will ...'
%
They said the same thing about Urkle; that little snot.  Boy I'd like
to smack that kid.
%
Step aside, everyone!  Sensitive love letters are my specialty.  Dear
Baby, Welcome to Dumpsville.  Population: you.
%
Marge:	Homie, are you really going to ignore Grampa for the rest of
	your life?

Homer:	Of course not, Marge, just for the rest of his life.
%
Laser effects, mirrored balls -- John Williams must be rolling around
in his grave.
%
Well, I acquired it legally, you can be sure of that.
%
You see, boy?  The real money's in bootlegging!  Not in your childish
vandalism.
%
Oh, well, of course, everything looks bad if you remember it.
%
Yeah, Moe, that team sure did suck last night!  They just plain
sucked!  I've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch 
of sucks that ever sucked!
%
Come on, honey.  You work yourself stupid for this family.  If anyone
deserves to be wrapped up in seaweed and buried in mud, it's you.
%
Marge:	What if he's crazy?

Homer:	And what if he's not?  Then we'd look like idiots.
%
Woman:	I'm not going to press charges, but I assume you'll want to
	punish him.

Homer:	'Preciate the suggestion, lady, but he hates that.  And I
	gotta live with him.

Bart:	You're the man, Homer.
%
It's a fixer-upper.  What's the problem?  We get a bunch of priests in 
here ...
%
It's your child versus mine!  The winner will be showered with praise, 
the loser will be taunted and booed until my throat is sore.
%
It's wonderful, it's magical.  Oh boy, here it comes.  Another mouth.
%
I guess Bart's not to blame.  He's lucky, too, because it's spanking
season, and I got a hankering for some spankering!
%
Aw, being a clown sucks.  You get kicked by kids, bit by dogs, and
admired by the elderly.  Who am I clowning?  I have no business being
a clown!  I'm leaving the clowning business to all the other clowns in 
the clowning business.
%
Ah, so that's what's been wrong with the little fella.  He misses
casual sex.
%
Who spread garbage all over Flanders's yard before I got a chance to?
%
Homer:	I suppose you want to probe me.  Well, you might as well get
	it over with.

Kang:	Stop!  We have reached the limits of what rectal probing can
	teach us.
%
You see, there are some crybabies out there -- religious types mostly
-- who might be offended.  If you are one of them, I advise you to
turn off your set now.  C'mon, I dare you.  Bock-bock-bock-bock-bock!
Chicken!
%
He gets it from your side of the family, you know.  No monsters on my
side.
%
Why don't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for jerks?
%
So if we don't all vote the same way, we'll be deadlocked and have to
be sequestered in the Springfield Palace Hotel ...
%
Woo Hoo!  Good news everybody!  Because I endangered lives, we can fly 
anywhere we want!
%
What's everyone so worked up about?  So there's a comet.  Big deal.
It'll burn up in out atmosphere, and whatever's left will be no bigger 
than a chihuahua's head.
%
Marge, I ate those fancy soaps you bought for the bathroom.
%
There are perfectly good answers to those questions, but they'll have
to wait for another night.
%
Homer:	Look at that.  I'm the first non-Brazilian person to travel
	backwards through time.

Mr. Peabody:
	Correction, Homer, you're the second.

Sherman:
	That's right, Mr. Peabody!

Mr. Peabody:
	Quiet, you.
%
Homer:	But wait.  You can't kill me for being Krusty.  I'm not him.
	I'm Homer Simpson.

Fat Tony:
	The same Homer Simpson who crashed his car through the wall of 
out club?

Homer:	Uh ... actually my name is Barney.  Yeah.  Barney Gumble.
%
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?  No.  Lumber Lung?  No.  Jugglers despair?
No.  Achy-Breaky Pelvis?  No.  Oh, I'm never going to be disabled.
I'm sick of being so healthy!  Hey wait -- Hyper-Obesity.  If you
weigh more than 300 pounds, you qualify as disabled.
%
Homer/Apu/Moe:
	You can do it, Otto!
	You can do it, Otto!

Apu:	Make this spare, I'll give you free gelato!

Moe:	Then go back to my place where I will get you blotto!

Homer:	Domo arigato, Mister Roboto!
%
Marge:	It was a beautiful wedding.  I've never seen Selma happier.

Homer:	That reminds me -- Troy said something interesting last night
	at the bar.  Apparently he doesn't really love Selma and the
	marriage is just a sham to help his career.
%
Homer:	Dig him up!!!  Dig up that corpse!  If you really love
	Jebediah Springfield, you'll haul his bones out of the ground
	to prove my daughter wrong!  Dig up his grave!  Pull out his
	tongue!

Quimby:	Can't we have one meeting that doesn't end with us digging up
	a corpse?
%
Alone!  I'm alone!  I'm a lonely, insignificant speck on a has-been
planet orbited by a cold, indifferent sun!
%
Our lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or I.  Many of
them incompetent boobs.  I know this because I've worked alongside
them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions 
time and again and I say this stinks.
%
Around the house, I never lift a finger
As a husband and father I'm sub-par
I'd rather drink a beer
than win Father of the Year
I'm happy with things the way they are
%
Bart:	You know, Grampa kinda smells like that trunk in the garage where the bottom's all wet.

Lisa:	Nuh-uh, he smells more like a photo lab.

Homer:	Stop it, both of you!  Grampa smells like a regular old man,
	which is more like a hallway in a hospital.
%
That's weird.  It's like something out of that twilighty show about
that zone.
%
Well, you'll be happy to know I don't work very hard.  Actually, I'm
bringing the plant down from the inside.
%
Bart:	What religion are you?

Homer:	You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don'twork out in real life, uh, Christianity.
%
To alcohol!  The cause of -- and solution to -- all of life's problems!
%
Oh, the guys are work are going to have a field day with this.
%
Where is Bart, anyway?  His dinner's getting all cold and eaten.
%
Homer:	We always have one good kid and one lousy kid.  Why can't both 	our kids be good?

Marge:	We have three kids, Homer.
%
Look, Marge, I'm sorry I haven't been a better husband, I'm sorry
about the time I tried to make gravy in the bathtub, I'm sorry I used
your wedding dress to wax the car, and I'm sorry -- oh well, let's
just say I'm sorry for the whole marriage up to this point.
%
Television -- teacher, mother, secret lover!
%
It's just that I've only seen this movie twice before, and I've seen
you every night for the last eleven ye -- aha.  What I mean to say is: 
We'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie.  I promise.
%
This is even more painful than it looks.
%
The only danger is if they send us to that terrible Planet of the Apes 
... Wait a minute, Statue of Liberty -- that was our planet!  You
maniacs!  You blew it up!  Damn you!  Damn you all to hell!
%
Michael:
	Hi.  I'm Michael Jackson, from The Jacksons.

Homer:	I'm Homer Simpson, from the Simpsons.
%
Homer:	I want everyone to know that this is Ned Flanders ... myfriend!

Lenny:	What'd he say?

Carl:	I dunno.  Somethin' about being gay.
%
I'm a white male, aged 18 to 49.  Everyone listens to me!  No matter
how dumb my suggestions are.
%
Oh everything's cruel according to you.  Keeping him chained us in the 
backyard is cruel.  Pulling his tail is cruel.  Yelling in his ears is 
cruel.  Everything is cruel.  So excuse me if I'm cruel.
%
Well let's call them, uh, Mr. X and Mrs. Y.  So anyway, Mr. X would
say, `Marge, if this doesn't get your motor running, my name isn't
Homer J. Simpson.'
%
It's not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled child, but
somehow I managed to squeeze in 8 hours of TV a day.
%
Homer:	You know what?

Grampa:	What?

Homer:	We're both screw-ups.
%
Homer:	Marge, it's 3 a.m. and I worked all day!

Marge:	It's 9:30 p.m. and you spent your whole Saturday drinking beer in Maggie's kiddie pool.
%
Mr. Scorpio says productivity is up 2% and it's all because of my
motivational techniques, like donuts and the possibility of more
donuts to come.
%
Marge:	You will not be getting a tattoo for Christmas.

Homer:	Yeah.  If you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your own allowance.
%
Merchant:
	Sir, I must strongly advise you, do not purchase this.  Behind 
	every wish lurks grave misfortune.  I, myself, was one
	president of Algeria.

Homer:	C'mon, pal, I don't want to hear your life story!  Paw me.
%
Cable.  It's more wonderful than I dared hope.
%
Ohh, my son doesn't stand a chance!  The whole world has gone gay!
%
Marge:	This is the best gift of all, Homer.

Homer:	It is?

Marge:	Yes, something to share our love.  And frighten prowlers.
%
I've figured out the boy's punishment.  First, he's grounded.  No
leaving the house, not even for school.  Second, no eggnog.  In fact,
no nog, period.  And third, absolutely no stealing for three months.
%
Homer:	I'm just a big fool.

Karl:	Oh no, you're not!

Homer:	How do you know?

Karl:	Because my mother taught me never to kiss a fool!
%
Unlike most of you, I am not a nut.
%
Coyote:	Fear not, Homer.  I am your spirit guide.

Homer:	Hiya.

Coyote:	There is a lesson you must learn.

Homer:	If it's about laying off the insanity peppers, I'm way ahead of ya.
%
Dasher, Dancer ... Prancer ... Nixon, Comet, Cupid ... Donna Dixon.
%
Bart:	Hey, Santa, what's shaking?

Homer:	What's your name, Bart ... ner? -- er, little partner?

Bart:	I'm Bart Simpson.  Who the hell are you?
%
But let me tell you, the slim lazy Homer you knew is dead.  Now I'm a
big fat dynamo.
%
So, like us, let your children run wild and free, because as the old
saying goes, let your children run wild and free.
%
And remember not to act afraid.  Animals can smell fear.  And they
don't like it.
%
You heard me.  I won't be in for the rest of the week ... I told you.
My baby beat me up ... Oh, it is not the worst excuse I ever thought
up.
%
Time to fertilize the lawn.  A couple of 500-pound bags should do it!
